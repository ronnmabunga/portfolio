# My Portfolio

This repository hosts a website portfolio that showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer. Here, you can find details about my work, technologies Iâ€™ve used, and ways to get in touch with me.

## About Me

I am a software developer who thrives on solving problems with a logical and structured approach. I believe that coding should be orderly, which allows me to follow standard practices and create maintainable solutions. I strive to write code that is not only efficient but also easy to read for both myself and others. I enjoy learning new technologies and actively seek opportunities to apply them in my projects.
